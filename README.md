# Music Releases

This project was to build a website that shows new album and single releases. We practiced React and creating components using data from Spotify. The album titles and artists are linked to Spotify. This was a pair programming project.
## The problem

We started off by fetching the right information from the Spotify API and then displayed the album covers using React. We used map to iterate over an array of albums. We wrote React props, used React components and mounted them. 

If we had more time we would include a playlist in a sidebar.
